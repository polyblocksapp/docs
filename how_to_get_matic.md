## Prerequisites

### Setup MetaMask wallet

- Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), which is one of the most popular wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Add Polygon network to your wallet through [the official instruction](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/).

## Recommended (Fast & cheap)

### Transfer from some CEX to Polygon network

- Purchase MATIC on some CEX (Recommended: Binance, crypto.com)
- Transfer (or withdraw) your MATIC from the CEX to your Metamask wallet.

We strongly recommend this to save gas fees!
For Binance users, click [here](#binance) for the details. For crypto.com users, click [here](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5597853-send-and-receive-polygon-matic)  
We currently know that Binance, crypto.com, bybit, gate.io, OKEx can transfer directly to MATIC network.  
**Please be aware that they allow to transfer to the MATIC (Polygon) network, not to the ERC20 (Ethereum) network.**  
If you strongly want to use Coinbase, proceed to the "Advanced", but you should expect high gas fees.  


## Advanced (Expect high gas fees)

### Bridge from ERC20 Ethrerum network to Polygon network

If you have some ERC20 tokens on Ethereum network or your favorite CEX doesn’t transfer to MATIC (Polygon) network, you need to <b>bridge</b> tokens on Ethrerum network to MATIC (Polygon) network.

- Get some tokens such as MATIC, ETH or USDC on your favorite CEX/DEX. Note that those tokens have to be transferable to Ethrerum network (ERC20). (Skip this if you already have some)
- Transfer (or withdraw) them to your Metamask wallet via ERC20 on Ethrerum network. (Skip this if you already have ERC20 tokens in yout MetaMask wallet)
- Bridge tokens from Ethreum network to MATIC network at [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge). (This needs to be PoS Bridge).
- Swap the tokens to MATIC at [the Polygon official Swap](https://wallet.polygon.technology/token-swap) if the bridged tokens are not MATIC.

## ABOUT

Similar to Art Blocks on Ethereum, fx(hash) on Tezos, PolyBlocks is an open platform for generative NFTs.  
Its excellent user interface allows artists to mint their artworks in a very simple process.  
Our tokens are based on ERC-721. Please visit <a href="https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0EbA52CccC57052CDB43EAE1D7d0B2715A0fe24E#code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="inline-anchor">polygonscan</a> for the smart contract.  

## HOW IT WORKS

- Mint your artwork via our smart contract using the “mint” button in the menu
- Your artwork will be listed in our marketplace
- A token (or NFT, or edition) will be minted when a collector makes a purchase, with a newly generated version of the artwork


## CURRENTLY BETA

PolyBlocks is still in its early stages: it is in beta. Please keep in mind that bugs may occur.  
We strongly recommend keeping the price low, so that people can experiment and test your tokens for now.  
We hope that the token contract will not be updated, but that could very well happen.  

## FEES

The fees for using PolyBlocks during the beta are as follows:

- When minting a new token from an artwork, PolyBlocks takes 3% of the token's price as a platform fee
- When a PolyBlocks token is sold in the secondary market, PolyBlocks takes 3% of its value as a platform fee
- PolyBlocks does not charge any fee when minting new artwork (the artist only needs to pay gas for the transaction)

PolyBlocks is still estimating the running costs, and there is the possibility that the fee might change after beta. We are doing our best to keep the costs low.
